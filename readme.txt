This is a archival copy of the Neo-Geo/MVS game Art of Fighting.

The code was retrieved from the PC Engine version of AoF, due to a
error in how the master image was created.

Build instructions from the original thread are the following:

decompress everything in your C drive
You should get an MRI folder
Launch DOSBOX (heh yes it doesn't work under windows x64).
Go in MRI
launch SetPath
go in AOF
launch make
go in bin
launch makeout
then, from a windows command line (not dosbox)
in this same folder, launch makerom
and you will get the file 044-p1.p1, the program code.

This has been made available purely for archival/research purposes and should
probably not be used for any commercial activity. I do not hold the copyrights
to this, so please do not ask me any questions concerning IPRs of this.
